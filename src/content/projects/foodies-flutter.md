Foodies is a fully functional mobile recipe application built with Flutter during my university studies. Unlike the design prototype, this is the actual implementation of the recipe app with complete functionality.

## Features

- Browse and search recipes by name, ingredients, or category
- Save favorite recipes to personal collection
- Recipe detail screens with ingredients and step-by-step instructions
- Share recipes to other apps
- User profile and preferences management
- Offline recipe access with local storage

## Technical Implementation

- **Framework:** Flutter for iOS and Android
- **Language:** Dart
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore for data, Cloud Functions for APIs)
- **State Management:** Provider for efficient app state handling
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture with proper separation of concerns

## Key Learnings

- Mobile app development from concept to deployment
- Working with REST APIs and Firebase services
- Implementing offline-first functionality
- User authentication and authorization
- Push notifications integration
- App store submission process
